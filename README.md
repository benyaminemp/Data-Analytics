# Data-Analytics

## Overview
This repository hosts a collection of models, dashboards, and algorithms developed during my PhD research on data analytics, machine learning, and predictive modelling. The goal is to contribute open, reproducible, and well-documented code to the battery and sustainability research community. More tools and models will be added over time as my research progresses and results are published.

## Projects Included

### ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Battery Prediction
A simple feedforward neural network implementation for battery-related predictive tasks such as state estimation or capacity forecasting.

### ðŸ”¹ Data Visaulisation: Washington EV Analysis Dashboard
An interactive Tableau dashboard visualising the electric vehicle (EV) population across Washington State. This dashboard presents insights into vehicle types, geographical distribution, and temporal trends in EV adoption using open data from Data.gov.

## ðŸ”„ Upcoming Projects
Additional tools and advanced models will be added after the publication of associated papers. This includes extended electrochemical models and neural network surrogate models.

## Getting Started
Each subfolder contains:
- A dedicated `README.md`
- Code (scripts or notebooks)
- Example data or usage instructions

To explore a project:
```bash
cd ProjectName
```
Then follow the instructions in the respective `README.md`.
